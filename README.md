# resir

## what's in a name?

resir can stand for:

 * Rebecca's easy sites in ruby
 * Ridiculously easy sites in ruby
 * Really exasperatingly stupid ill-conceived rubbish

## what's it do?

Hardly anything, really.

resir can be run like yet another ruby web framework 
or it can be run by simply using eruby

It's not meant to solve your database-driven website 
problems

It's meant to make it ridiculously easy to make mostly 
static web sites using whatever markup / templating 
language you want

resir is supposed to stay out of your way and help 
the poor souls out there that want to iteratively 
move their current web sites to resir

resir should be able to run your current html/php 
website, as is, and let you iteratively improve your site

It doesn't hide your files in deep, dark directory 
structures and it doesn't force you to create a 
complicated directory layout

resir is meant to help you create / maintain / improve 
one web site, or multiple

Run it using eruby, cgi, fastcgi, mongrel, thin ... whatever!

Mostly static web sites should be ridiculously easy.
resir tries to make that a reality.
