# 
# auto creates partial-esque helper methods for each subdirectory in your site
#
# if you have these directories:
#     ./partials
#     ./puppies
#
# then, if you require 'resir/helpers/partial', you'll you can:
#     <%= partial :nav %>
#     <%= puppy :rover %>
#

# puts "require 'resir/helpers/partial' OBSOLETE.  need to make new version of this ..."

# nothing here ... moved into Resir proper for testing ... move back out asap ... 
# just haven't been able to get it to work as i want it to, as a helper
