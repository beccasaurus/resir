Simple tests to run against Resir's example websites

Story: Example website output tests

  I want to test the output of requests 
  to Resir's example websites as a way 
  to help make Specs read easier and to 
  keep them more DRY

  Scenario: Full path to .html Template

    Given I goto site: for_stories
    When I visit hello-story.html
    Then the output should be 'hello stories!'
    And the status should be 200

  Scenario: Short path to .html Template

    Given I goto site: for_stories
    When I visit hello-story
    Then I should see 'hello stories'

  Scenario: Nonexistent path

    Given I goto site: for_stories
    When I visit i-don't-exist
    Then I should see 'file not found'
    And the status should be 404 

  Scenario: Simple ERB Template

    Given I goto site for_stories
    When I visit /render-me
    Then I should see 'rendered by erb!'

  Scenario: Have access to Resir::Site as @site
 
    Given I goto site for_stories
    When I visit site-variable-test
    Then I should see 'root path: examples/for_stories'

  Scenario: Be able to call render partials/page

    Given I goto site partials_test
    When I visit render-test
    Then the output should be 'page says: hello from partial!'

  Scenario: Be able to call partial page

    Given I goto site partials_test
    When I visit partial-test
    Then the output should be 'page says: hello from partial!'
