Example website tests moved from RSpec tests

Story: More example website output tests

  I wrote these initially in RSpec but 
  these fit perfectly into stories

  Scenario: Should output and have 200 status if file found

    Given I goto site: ambrose/starmonkey
    When I visit elf
    Then I should see 'hello from the elf'
    And the status should be 200

  Scenario: Should output with 200 if file found (with leading slash)

    Given I goto site: ambrose/starmonkey
    When I visit /elf
    Then I should see 'hello from the elf'
    And the status should be 200

  Scenario: Should output with 200 if file found (with trailing slash)

    Given I goto site: ambrose/starmonkey
    When I visit elf/
    Then I should see 'hello from the elf'
    And the status should be 200

  Scenario: Should support directory_index

    Given I goto site: ambrose/starmonkey
    When I visit /
    Then the output should be 'Hello From Index'

  Scenario: Should have access to instance variables

    Given I goto site: ambrose/starmonkey
    When I visit print-env
    Then the output should be 'print-env'

  Scenario: Should 404 if file not found

    Given I goto site: ambrose/starmonkey
    When I visit chunky-bacon
    Then I should see 'file NOT found'
    And the status should be 404

  Scenario: Should render a layout, if a layout exists

    Given I goto site layout_test
    When I visit no-layout
    Then the output should be 'page content'

  Scenario: Should be able to disable a layout

    Given I goto site layout_test
    When I visit page
    Then the output should be '>>page content<<'
